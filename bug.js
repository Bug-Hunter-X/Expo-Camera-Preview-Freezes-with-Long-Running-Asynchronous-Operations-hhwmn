This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component in conjunction with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.  The problem arises because the camera preview might stop updating or display a blank screen if the asynchronous operation takes too long to complete. This is because the camera component may get unmounted or its state is updated while the asynchronous operation is still in progress.  Here's an example:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = React.useState(null);
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');

      // Simulate an asynchronous operation that takes time
      const response = await fetch('https://some-slow-api.com/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; //Loading View
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} />
  );
};

export default App;
```
